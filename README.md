Python Web Development Techdegree Project 4 - Work Log with Database


## Description
In order to prepare better timesheets for your company, you've been asked to develop

The script should ask for a task name, how much time was spent on the task, 
and any general notes about the task. Record each of these items into a database.

Provide a way for a user to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date or 
that match a search string (either as a regular expression or a plain text search). 
Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, 
time spent, and general notes.
